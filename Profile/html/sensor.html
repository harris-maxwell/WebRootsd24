            <h2>Android Sensors</h2>
            <p>Accelerometer: Detects device motion and orientation. Useful in gaming, vehicle navigation, and fitness apps.
                Gyroscope: Provides orientation details that are more precise than the accelerometer alone.
                Magnetometer: Acts as a digital compass, useful for navigation apps.
                Barometer: Measures atmospheric pressure; can be used in weather forecasting apps and altitude measurement.
                Proximity Sensor: Detects how close the phone is to an external object, like your face during a call.</p>

            <h2>iOS Sensors</h2>
            <p>Accelerometer: As in Android, it measures changes in velocity and orientation.
                Gyroscope: Enhances motion detection capabilities alongside the accelerometer.
                Magnetometer: Helps in determining orientation relative to Earth's magnetic field.
                Barometer: Available in newer models, used for determining altitude and weather changes.
                LiDAR Scanner: Found in the latest models, used for augmented reality (AR) applications and improving camera focus.</p>
